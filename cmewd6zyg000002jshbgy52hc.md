Reading “C.T. Stud” by Norman Grubb, I was struck by the raw honesty and spiritual intensity of Stud’s journey. His candid reflections on personal struggle, faith, and transformation reveal a life marked by both humility and bold conviction. The recurring themes of surrender, assurance in Christ, and the difference between superficial religion and genuine spiritual fire resonated deeply. Stud’s emphasis on trusting God over human wisdom, moving from mere soul-saving to true discipleship, and his passionate call to authenticity in faith, challenged me to reflect on my own walk with Christ and the true meaning of commitment.

Here are some lines that stood out to me the most:

> Then I got down on my knees and I did say thank you to God and right then and there joy and peace came into my soul. I knew then what it was to be born again in the Bible which had been so dry to me before became everything- page 21
> 
> Instead of going and telling others of the love of Christ, I was selfish and kept the knowledge to myself. The result was that gradually my love began to go grow cold and the love of the world began to come in. I spent 6 years in that unhappy backslidding state - page 36
> 
> For instead of trusting entirely to God to show me, I went to my friends. Thus, I tried to find out the Lord's guidance by common Sense and instead of getting into the light I got into darkness, I became very restless and anxious. My health gave way and I had to go into the country to recuperate- page 38
> 
> I am not willing but I am willing to be made willing- page 51
> 
> He wanted to take away the sham jewels to give me the real ones- page 51
> 
> Remember that mere soul saving is comparatively easy work and is not nearly so important as that of manufacturing the saved ones into saints soldiers and saviors- page 80
> 
> God has made things so plain to me and enables me to put it plainly to others. Here is the gist of what I tell them. Assurance of salvation depends on the fact that Jesus paid the penalty of your sin not on any feeling of yours as Christ died for you. You belong by rights to him. After further explanation, I say will you not in a practical business way on your knees, yield yourself and all to Jesus? Yes, then he or she says does it and I ask if Jesus has accepted them. If they do not know, I simply ask if God is a liar, which at once produces the required assurance as it is impossible for God to have lied. Then I tell the inquirer to ask in one sentence for the holy Spirit and he does it. That I ask has he been given by they say method the answer comes back. Yes then I tell him to thank God for one having accepted him and two having given the holy Spirit. Then I say don't worry or fret or think or try but just be anxious from nothing. Only trust and obey his voice. Rejoice and be glad in Jesus always. The feeling will come in due course but is it? It is a fact that God has given the holy Spirit do not hinder God by helping him but quit hindering him. They come long-faced and go away sparkling and beaming- page 107
> 
> I always think that the essence of a good dinner or breakfast party is not the tablecloth nor even the nature of the food, but the company I think precisely the same concerning the Lord supper- page 124
> 
> But this can only be accomplished by a red, hot unconventional unfettered, holy Ghost religion where neither church nor State neither man nor traditions are worshiped or preached, but only Christ and him crucified- page 167
> 
> Don't go into the study to prepare a sermon. He once said that is all nonsense go into your study to go to God and get so fiery that your tongue is like a burning hole and you've got to speak- page 227
