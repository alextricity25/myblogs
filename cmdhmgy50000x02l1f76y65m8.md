The post discusses configuring single sign-out with an Okta SAML application. The service provider is an AWS Cognito pool with direct SAML federation with Okta. The author mentions there is one "gotcha" in the configuration process.

The blog post begins with the author noting it has been a while since his last tech-related blog post. He explains that he wants to improve his writing skills and share knowledge.

## Configuration Steps

1. Navigate to the Application's SAML configurations
    
2. Click on the SAML application
    
3. Go to the "General" tab
    
4. Click "Edit" in the SAML Settings section
    

The post appears to be a technical guide for developers working with Okta and SAML authentication.
