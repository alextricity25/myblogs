### Directions

1. **Cut the Bread:**  
    Slice the baguette or rolls in half lengthwise using a serrated knife.
    
2. **Scoop the Bread:**  
    Gently scoop out some of the bread from the inside to make room for the fillings. (Enjoy the extra bread or save for homemade breadcrumbs.)
    
3. **Make the Spread:**  
    Mix together the basil pesto and Greek yogurt or mayonnaise.
    
4. **Spread on Bread:**  
    Evenly spread the pesto mixture onto both cut sides of the bread, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies.
    
5. **Add Toppings:**  
    Layer the mozzarella and tomato slices on the bottom half of the bread. Sprinkle with flaky salt and freshly ground black pepper.
    
6. **Finish:**  
    Add fresh basil leaves and arugula. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar or glaze and a bit of extra-virgin olive oil. Place the top half of the bread on and press gently.
    
7. **Serve:**  
    Enjoy the sandwiches cold, or toast them in the oven for a warm, melty version. Slice and serve.
