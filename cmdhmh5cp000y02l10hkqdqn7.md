# Paella!

*February 07, 2018*

As my Mom put it, Paella is one of the best thing my Dad does in the kitchen. The video below is a small compilation explaining the prep process and showing how it is cooked.

A more detailed recipe will be reserved for another post. I figured, since I've never personally made this Paella, that I'm not the right candidate for the feat. Maybe once life has me again in a more permanent location, I'll take on the challenge :)

In the meantime the video will do.

Paella is by-far my favorite dish made by my parents. I hope this record will live on for many years.
