Alex’s Enfrijolada

This recipe came together while making black bean soup and realizing I had extra tortillas and cheese on hand. After assembling a quesadilla with provolone and pepper jack, I decided to smother it in the black bean soup and finish with cotija cheese, avocado, and sour cream. Here’s how to make it:

**Ingredients**

**For the Quesadilla:**

* Flour tortillas
    
* Provolone cheese
    
* Pepper jack cheese
    

**For the Black Bean Soup:**

* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
    
* 1 large red onion, chopped
    
* 1 large carrot, peeled and diced
    
* 2 celery ribs, diced
    
* 1 jalapeño pepper, deseeded and diced
    
* 4 garlic cloves, minced
    
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
    
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
    
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
    
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
    
* ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
    
* 3 (15-ounce) cans low-sodium black beans, drained and rinsed
    
* 3 cups low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth (add more if needed)
    
* 1–2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
    

**Optional Toppings:**

* Cotija cheese
    
* Avocado
    
* Sour cream
    
* Fresh cilantro
    
* Red onion
    
* Extra lime wedges
    

**Directions**

1. **Make the Black Bean Soup:**  
    Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion, carrot, celery, and jalapeño; cook 4–5 minutes until softened. Stir in garlic, cumin, oregano, coriander, cayenne, and salt; cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add black beans and broth, bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Use an immersion blender to partially puree the soup, leaving some texture. Stir in lime juice.
    
2. **Assemble the Quesadilla:**  
    Place provolone and pepper jack cheese between two flour tortillas. Toast in a skillet over medium heat until the cheese melts and the tortillas are golden.
    
3. **Assemble the Enfrijolada:**  
    Place the quesadilla on a plate and ladle the black bean soup generously over it. Top with cotija cheese, avocado, sour cream, and any other desired toppings.
