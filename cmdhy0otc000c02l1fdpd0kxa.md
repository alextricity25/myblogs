In June of 2025, my family and I visited Terlingua and stayed in inflatable bubbles with clear vinal ceilings. Here is a concise things of what we think you should know before booking!

1. The bubbles are spaced far apart. Bubble Terlingua has several bubbles scattered throughout the city. There’s a section of “community bubbles” that share a pool and are separated by concrete walls—this is where we stayed. Keep in mind that if you are going with family and staying in different bubbles, it’s very possible that you will end up staying about 10-15 minutes apart from one another.

    They also have an area a little further out near a restaurant called “Venga”. This is where my sister-in-law stayed. WARNING: The roads are bit rough in this area!

    They also have some bubbles with their own pool on top of a hill! My father-in-law stayed in this one.

2. It’s about a one hour drive to Big Bend National Park
    
3. Our favorite restaurant was easily “Venga.” We also tried Starlight Diner and Espresso y Poco Mas. Starlight Diner had a great atmosphere with live music, but the cafeteria-style food was underwhelming. Venga stood out for its lively, unique vibe and outstanding food—their smash burger is a must-try.
