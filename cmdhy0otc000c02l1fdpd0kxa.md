In June 2025, my family and I visited Terlingua and stayed in inflatable bubbles with clear vinyl ceilings. If you’re considering booking, here are a few key things to know:

1. The bubbles are spaced far apart. Bubble Terlingua offers several bubbles scattered throughout the area. There’s a section of “community bubbles” that share a pool and are separated by concrete walls—this is where we stayed. If you’re traveling with family and booking multiple bubbles, be aware that you could end up 10–15 minutes apart.

2. There’s another area near the restaurant “Venga,” where my sister-in-law stayed. Heads up: the roads leading here are rough!

    Some bubbles have their own private pool on top of a hill. My father-in-law stayed in one of these.

3. It’s about an hour’s drive to Big Bend National Park.
    
4. Our favorite restaurant was “Venga” for its lively atmosphere and outstanding food—the smash burger is a must-try. We also visited Starlight Diner and Espresso y Poco Mas. Starlight Diner had live music and a fun vibe, but the cafeteria-style food was underwhelming.
    

Overall, Bubble Terlingua is a unique experience—just be prepared for some distance between accommodations and a bit of rugged driving!
